# Enterprise Java and Quarkus (EJQ) ‚Äî Source Code for Substack Articles

This repository contains the source code and hands-on examples for the [Enterprise Java and Quarkus](https://myfear.substack.com/) Substack publication by [Markus Eisele](https://twitter.com/myfear).

If you're working in enterprise software with Java, Quarkus, Jakarta EE, and cloud-native platforms, this is your launchpad for modern development.

## üì∞ About the Publication

[**EJQ on Substack**](https://myfear.substack.com/) is a curated collection of technical articles, guides, and deep dives focused on helping developers and architects:

- Build fast, cloud-native apps with **Quarkus**
- Secure microservices with **Vault**, TOTP, and secrets management
- Integrate **LangChain4j** and **AI services** into Java applications
- Design resilient, scalable systems using **Kubernetes** and **Dev Services**
- Understand modern patterns like **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, validation layers, and service guardrails

All content is hands-on, enterprise-relevant, and written for people building real systems‚Äînot prototypes.
