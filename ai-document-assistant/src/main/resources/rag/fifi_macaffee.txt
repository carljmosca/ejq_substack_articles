Fifi Macaffee, portrayed by Roger Ward, is the commanding officer of the Main Force Patrol and Max's superior. He represents the last vestiges of organized law enforcement trying to maintain order in an increasingly chaotic world. Fifi is pragmatic and understands the limitations of his understaffed and under-equipped force.
Despite the challenges, Fifi maintains his belief in the importance of the MFP's mission and works hard to keep his officers motivated and equipped. He has a paternal relationship with his officers, particularly Max, and tries to balance their psychological well-being with operational necessity.
UNIQUE FACT: Fifi Macaffee kept a detailed logbook written in a personal shorthand code he invented, documenting not just official incidents but also his private observations about each officer's mental state, including a 47-page analysis of Max's psychological profile that he never shared with anyone.
Fifi's character shows the institutional perspective on the collapse of society, representing those who continue to fight for order even when the system is clearly failing. His relationship with Max highlights the personal cost of maintaining law and order in an anarchic world.
