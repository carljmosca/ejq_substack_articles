Jim Goose, portrayed by Steve Bisley, is Max's best friend and fellow MFP officer. Known for his reckless driving style and devil-may-care attitude, Goose serves as both comic relief and a representation of the psychological toll that constant violence takes on the police force.
Goose is characterized by his humor and loyalty to Max, but also by an increasing recklessness that suggests he's not coping well with the stress of their job. He drives aggressively and often puts himself in unnecessary danger, which foreshadows his eventual fate.
UNIQUE FACT: Jim Goose collected vintage harmonicas and could play 23 different blues songs from memory, often performing impromptu concerts for fellow officers during their meal breaks at the MFP station.
Goose's horrific death in a fiery car crash, orchestrated by Toecutter's gang, serves as the first major loss that begins Max's psychological unraveling. His death demonstrates that even the skilled MFP officers are not safe from the escalating violence on the roads.
