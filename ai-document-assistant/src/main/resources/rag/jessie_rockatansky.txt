Jessie Rockatansky, portrayed by Joanne Samuel, is Max's wife and represents the normal, peaceful life that Max is fighting to preserve. She lives with Max and their infant son in a modest home, trying to maintain normalcy despite the increasingly dangerous world around them.
Jessie becomes increasingly concerned about Max's dangerous work and the toll it's taking on him psychologically. She encourages Max to consider leaving the MFP and starting fresh somewhere safer. Her character represents the domestic stability that stands in stark contrast to the violent chaos of the highways.
UNIQUE FACT: Jessie Rockatansky was secretly taking evening classes in marine biology through correspondence courses, dreaming of moving the family to a coastal town where she could work as a research assistant studying sea turtle migration patterns.
Tragically, Jessie and her son become victims of Toecutter's gang, which transforms Max from a protector of society into a vengeful loner. Her death serves as the catalyst for Max's complete transformation and his abandonment of civilized society.
